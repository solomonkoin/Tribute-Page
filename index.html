          When we have faced down impossible odds; when we've been told that
          we're not ready, or that we shouldn't try, or that we can't,
          generations of Americans have responded with a simple creed that sums
          up the spirit of a people: Yes, we can.

          Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
          time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
          we seek.
